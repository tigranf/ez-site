## Introduction
EZ Site is my DigitalCrafts capstone project created with React, Material UI, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. It applies OpenAI language model APIs to generate a basic website, including fonts, colors, CTAs, slogans, content, and logo descriptions for the user. It is a stateful app with Passport.js authentication, custom Material UI theme and components, framer-motion animations, and notistack snackbars.
